###### Breaking Dishes
<font size=1>
something was off;  
it started when the brooms stood standing.  
something about gravity and magnetic forces.  

something was off this week  
when my frontal lobe flatlined in art class.  
        I stood in a charcoal trance:  
unmoved by perspective.  

my brain is a muscle and  
these days, I imagine it’s more like mush.  
it's not getting enough exercise. 

something was off when I disintegrated beneath the   
         20 pounds of my blanket,  
         like the density of my matter reached its vanishing point.

I get up on autopilot.   
bike to class.                         bike home.  
cut my hair because it looks lopsided.   
more.  
because something was off!  
more.  
drive to Richmond,  
on 64.  

something was off when it felt like someone else,  
someone tiny,  
was in my head with a joystick  
 driving for me.   

something was off when the woman in Casey Subaru told me  
*they’re killing time,   
so we’re killing time*  

we are all just killing time  
who is so tiny in my head and killing my time?!   

I’m on autopilot,  
when I see a Soccer Dad sticker on a Honda  
and I catch eyes with the driver,  
through my window                                                            through their window   
                                 and over the moving space between us,   
I look at the passing lines as they grow wide behind me and  
converge in front.  
d i z z y i n g, like the teacup ride or discrete mathematics.    
I don’t think about the speed, because my cruise is controlled.   
something was off when the Soccer Dad  
looked back at the road instantaneously,  
like he did something Wrong.  
did he?  
I continue without constant manual control.  
we pass roadkill  
and I’m afraid of nothing but four-legged guts all over the road.  
and Fathers. 

something was off:  
when I leaned into the wind  
to balance my bike,  
when the rain drenched my thighs,  
my cheeks,  
and I laughed   
hysterically, horrifically,  
              at myself in this mother of monsoons,  
my art portfolio flip flap flapping,  
a spurt of water drenching my  
asscrack.  
I laughed loud,  
and it was swift and startling,  
like breaking dishes.
